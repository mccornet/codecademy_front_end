# Test Driven Development

The goal of this unit is to introduce some advanced Test Driven Development (TDD) concepts that will help to test your web application as a whole. It will introduce Selenium, a suite of tools and libraries that enable and support automation of web browsers.

This unit will cover:

- mocking and stubbing
- Testing web apps with Sinon Library
- Testing web apps with Selenium

## Mocking

** 1. Test Coverage**

> In this article, you will learn about test coverage. This is helpful if you want to make it easier to catch regressions and edge cases in your code.

**2. Mocking, Stubbing, and Contract Testing**

> In this article, you will learn what mocking, stubbing, and contract testing is. This is helpful if you want to write tests that isolate a part of your application with more ease.

**3. Jest Mock Functions Documentation**

> In this documentation, you will learn how to mock functions using Jest. This is helpful if you want to write mocks for testing your application without worrying about third-party dependencies.

**4.  Tests React Applications Using Jest and Enzyme**

> In this article, you will learn how to write tests for your React application using Jest and Enzyme. This is helpful if you want to write tests to catch edge cases, regressions, and have more confidence in shipping updates to your users.
>
> This article uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of npm. Yarn is an alternative package manager. The syntax for Yarn is slightly different compared to npm. You can use either package manager when following along.
>
> ## Running packages
>
> - Using Yarn:
>
>   `yarn create-react-app my-app`
>
> - Using npm:
>
>   `npm create-react-app my-app`
>
> ## Adding dependencies
>
> - Using Yarn:
>
>   `yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 --dev`
>
> - Using npm:
>
>   `npm install enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 --save-dev`
>
> ## Running `package.json` scripts
>
> - Using Yarn:
>
>   `yarn run test`
>
> - Using npm:
>
>   `npm run test`

## Browser Automation

**1. Selenium Documentation**

> In this documentation, you will learn about Selenium. This is helpful if you want to write end-to-end tests for your application using a platform that enables automation of web browsers.

**2. Automating Functional Testing using Selenium**

> In this article, you will learn about functional testing with Selenium. This is helpful if you want to write end-to-end tests for your application to automate manual tests.

**3. Setting up Test Automation Environment**

> In this article, you will learn about browser automation testing using Selenium. This is helpful if you want to write end-to-end tests for your application to automate manual tests and how to run the tests on servers.
