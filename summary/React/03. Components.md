# Components

React applications are made out of *components.* A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is often to render some HTML. This section will look at *class components*. It is also possible to make *function components*.  All class components will have some methods and properties in common that is why it extends the `Component` class from the React library. `React.Component` is a JavaScript *class*. To create a component class, *subclass* `React.Component`. This is achieved like this: `class YourComponentNameGoesHere extends React.Component {}`.

Component class variable names must begin with capital letters. JSX elements can be either HTML-like, or *component instances*. JSX uses capitalization to distinguish between the two. There is only one property that has to be included in the class: a *render method.* A render method is a property whose *name* is `render`, and whose *value* is a function. The term “render method” can refer to the entire property, or to just the function part.

In order to render a component, the method named `render` needs to be called. This is done by passing it into `ReactDOM.render()`

**Example Code**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
// Creating a Component as a Class
class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
    render() { return <h1>Hello world</h1> }
};
// Creating an instance of the component and rendering it
ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

## Components and JSX

1. A multi-line JSX expression should always be wrapped in parentheses. That is why  a return statement often has parentheses around it.

   ```jsx
   render() {
       return (
           <div>
               <h1>Title</h1>
               <p>Content</p>
           </div>
       );
   }
   ```

   

2. As seen in the JSX section, inject JavaScript with curly braces, `{ }`, into JSX inside of a render function. For example to use variable attributes.

   ```jsx
   const img_scr ="img.png"
   
   class Example extends React.Component {
       render() { <img src={img_src} /> }
   }
   ```

   

3. Before the `return` statement in the `render()` regular JavaScript can be used.

   ```jsx
   render() {
       const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
       return <h1>The number is {n}!</h1>; 
   }
   ```

   

4. To use a function that is declared as a class member inside the `render` method the keyword `this` has to be used. Syntax: `{this.function-name}`, no curly braces.

   ```jsx
   class MyName extends React.Component {
       get name() { return "Marc"; }
       render() { return <h1>{`My name is ${this.name}.`}</h1> }
   }
   ```

   

5. Render functions often contain event listeners.

   ```jsx
   class Button extends React.Component {
       event_listener() { /* do something */ }
       render() { return <button onClick={this.event_listener}>Click Me!</button>;}
   }
   ```
