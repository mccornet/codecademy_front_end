# Style

## Inline Styles

There are many different ways to use styles in React.  An inline style is a style that’s written as an *attribute*, like this:

```jsx
<h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Hello world</h1>
```

The code contains double braces, when the entire JavaScript injection is *only* an object literal, then you will end up with double curly braces:

- The *outer* curly braces inject JavaScript into JSX. They say, “everything between us should be read as JavaScript, not JSX.” 

- The *inner* curly braces create a JavaScript object literal. They make this a valid JavaScript object:

  ```jsx
  { color: 'red' }
  ```

## Style Objects

An alternative that’s often nicer is to store a style object in a *variable*, and then inject that variable into JSX. In regular JavaScript, style *names* are written in hyphenated-lowercase. In React, those same names are instead written in camelCase. This has zero effect on style property *values*, only on style property *names*.

```jsx
// JavaScript Style
const styles = {
  'margin-top': '20px',
  'background-color': 'green'
};

// React Style
const styles = {
  marginTop: '20px',
  backgroundColor: 'green'
};
```

## Style Value Syntax

Style *names* are slightly different in React than they are in regular JavaScript. Likewise: style *values* are slightly different in React than they are in regular JavaScript. In regular JS, style *values* are almost always strings. Even if a style value is numeric, you usually have to write it as a string so that you can specify a unit. For example, you have to write `"450px"` or `"20%"`. In React, if you write a style value as a *number*, then the unit `"px"` is assumed. To use units other than “px,” use a string:

```jsx
{ fontSize: 30 }
{ fontSize: "2em" }
```

## Share Styles Across Multiple Components

One way to make styles *reusable* is to keep them in a separate JavaScript file. This file should *export* the styles that you want to reuse, via `export`. You can then `import` your styles into any component that wants them.

**Example Code**

```jsx
// Styles.js
const fontFamily = 'Comic Sans MS, Lucida Handwriting, cursive';
const background = 'pink url("https://content.codecademy.com/programs/react/images/welcome-to-my-homepage.gif") fixed';
const fontSize = '4em';
const padding = '45px 0';
const color = 'green';

export const styles = {
  fontFamily: fontFamily,
  background: background,
  fontSize: fontSize,
  padding: padding,
  color: color
};

// Home.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { styles } from './styles'

const divStyle = { // uses only a few properties
  background: styles.background,
  height: '100%' 
};

export class Example extends React.Component {
  render() { return <div style={divStyle}></div> }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Example />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

# Container components separated from Presentational Components

As you continue building your React application, you will soon realize that one component has too many responsibilities, but how do you know when you have reached that point? *Separating container components from presentational components* helps to answer that question. It shows you when it might be a good time to divide a component into smaller components. It also shows you how to perform that division.

Separating container components from presentational components is a popular React programming pattern. If a component has to have state, make calculations based on props, or manage any other complex logic, then that component shouldn’t also have to render HTML-like JSX. The functional part of a component (state, calculations, etc.) can be separated into a *container component*.

**Code Example**

Reworking Exercise. Original File:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const GUINEAPATHS = [
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-1.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-2.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-3.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-4.jpg'
];

class GuineaPigs extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { currentGP: 0 };
    this.interval = null;
    this.nextGP = this.nextGP.bind(this);
  }

  nextGP() {
    let current = this.state.currentGP;
    let next = ++current % GUINEAPATHS.length;
    this.setState({ currentGP: next });
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 5000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  render() {
    let src = GUINEAPATHS[this.state.currentGP];
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Guinea Pigs</h1>
        <img src={src} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <GuineaPigs />, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

**Part 1: Component**

1. Create a copy into components/GuineaPigs.js
2. Delete the render import and call from the component file
3. Export the class
4. Remove all logic and expect the img source to come in via a prop

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export class GuineaPigs extends React.Component {
    
  render() {
    let src = this.props.src;
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Guinea Pigs</h1>
        <img src={src} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

**Part 2: Container**

1. import the component

   ```jsx
   import { GuineaPigs } from '../components/GuineaPigs'
   ```

2. Rename the class to GuineaPigsContainer

3. Refactor the render function

   ```jsx
   render() { 
     const src = GUINEAPATHS[this.state.currentGP]; 
     return <GuineaPigs />;
   }
   ```

Resulting code:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { GuineaPigs } from '../components/GuineaPigs';

const GUINEAPATHS = [
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-1.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-2.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-3.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-4.jpg'
];

class GuineaPigsContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { currentGP: 0 };
    this.interval = null;
    this.nextGP = this.nextGP.bind(this);
  }

  nextGP() {
    let current = this.state.currentGP;
    let next = ++current % GUINEAPATHS.length;
    this.setState({ currentGP: next });
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 5000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  render() { 
    const src = GUINEAPATHS[this.state.currentGP]; 
    return <GuineaPigs src={src} />;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <GuineaPigsContainer />, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

**Summary**

In this programming pattern, the container component does the work of figuring out what to display. The presentational component does the work of actually displaying it. If a component does a significant amount of work in both areas, then that’s a sign to use this pattern.

1. Remove all of the presentation/rendering code from the container component
2. Remove all of the calculation/logic code from the presentational component
3. Accessed the presentational component from within the container using `import` and `export`
4. Edited the container’s `render()` method to render the presentational component with the proper props

# PropTypes

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
```

`propTypes` is an important React feature. `propTypes` are useful for two reasons. 

1. Prop validation. *Validation* can ensure that `props` are doing what they’re supposed to be doing. If `props` are missing, or if they’re present but they aren’t what they are expected, then a warning will print in the console.
2. Documentation. *Documenting* `props` makes it easier to glance at a file and quickly understand the component class inside.

**Code Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

export class ExampleClass extends React.Component {
  render() { return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1> }
}

// This propTypes object should have
// one property for each expected prop:
ExampleClass.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string
};
```

**PropTypes Properties**

1. The *name* of each property in `propTypes` should be the name of an expected `prop`. In our case, `MessageDisplayer` expects a `prop` named `message`, so our property’s *name* is `message`.

2. The *value* of each property in `propTypes` should fit this pattern:

   ```jsx
   PropTypes.expected_data_type_goes_here
   ```

   List of common PropTypes: (see the [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) for more information)

   ```jsx
   PropTypes.array
   PropTypes.bool
   PropTypes.func
   PropTypes.number
   PropTypes.object
   PropTypes.string
   PropTypes.symbol
   PropTypes.element // A React element
   PropTypes.instanceOf(ClassName) // Instance of a specific class
   PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.number) // Array of a specified type
   PropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.string) // Object with property values that are a specific value
   ```

3. If you add `.isRequired` to a `propType`, then you will get a console warning if that `prop` *isn’t* sent.

**Example Code from lesson**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

export class BestSeller extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <li>
        Title: <span>{this.props.title}</span><br />      
        Author: <span>{this.props.author}</span><br /> 
        Weeks: <span>{this.props.weeksOnList}</span>
      </li>
    );
  }
}

BestSeller.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  author: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  weeksOnList: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
};
```

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BestSeller } from './BestSeller';

export class BookList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Best Sellers</h1>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <BestSeller 
              title="Glory and War Stuff for Dads" 
              author="Sir Eldrich Van Hoorsgaard" 
              weeksOnList={10} />
			<!-- rest of list omitted -->
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<BookList />, document.getElementById('app'))
```

## PropTypes in function Components

Using Proptypes for function components is almost identical

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const Example = (props) => {
  return <h1>{props.message}</h1>;
}
 
Example.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};
```

# React Forms

[React Forms documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).

In a typical, non-React environment. A user types some data into a form’s input fields, and the server doesn’t know about it. The server remains clueless until the user hits a “submit” button, which sends all of the form’s data over to the server simultaneously. In React, as in many other JavaScript environments, this is not the best way of doing things.

The problem is the period of time during which a form thinks that a user has typed one thing, but the server thinks that the user has typed a different thing. What if, during that time, a *third* part of the website needs to know what a user has typed? It could ask the form or the server and get two different answers. In a complex JavaScript app with many moving, interdependent parts, this kind of conflict can easily lead to problems. In a React form, you want the server to know about every new character or deletion, *as soon as it happens*. That way, your screen will always be in sync with the rest of your application.

**Input onChange**

1. Create an event handler and a state to store the information
2. Put the processed input back into the value

**Example code from lesson**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

export class Input extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { userInput: ''}
    this.handleUserInput = this.handleUserInput.bind(this);
  }

  handleUserInput(e) { this.setState({ userInput : e.target.value }) }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input 
          type="text" 
          onChange={this.handleUserInput} 
          value={this.state.userInput} />
        <h1>{this.state.userInput}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Input />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

There are two terms that will probably come up when you talk about React forms: *controlled component* and *uncontrolled component*. An *uncontrolled component* is a component that maintains its own internal state. A *controlled component* is a component that does not maintain any internal state. Since a controlled component has no state, it must be *controlled* by someone else.

For example a typical `<input type='text' />` element. It appears onscreen as a text box. If you need to know what text is currently in the box, then you can ask the `<input />`, possibly with some code like this:

```jsx
let input = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');
let typedText = input.value; // input.value will be equal to whatever text is currently in the text box.
```

The important thing here is that the `<input />` *keeps track of* its own text. You can ask it what its text is at any time, and it will be able to tell you. The fact that `<input />` keeps track of information makes it an *uncontrolled component*. It maintains its own internal state, by remembering data about itself.

A *controlled component*, on the other hand, has no memory. If you ask it for information about itself, then it will have to get that information through `props`. Most React components are *controlled*. In React, when you give an `<input />` a `value` attribute, then: the `<input />` BECOMES controlled. It stops using its internal storage. This is a more ‘React’ way of doing things.
