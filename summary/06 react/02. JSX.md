# JSX

*JSX* is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML. JSX elements can have *attributes*, just like HTML elements can. If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be *compiled*. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a *JSX compiler* will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript. JSX elements are treated as JavaScript *expressions*. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

```jsx
const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
```

## Multiline JSX

- If a JSX expression takes up more than one line; then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses.
- JSX expression must have exactly *one* outermost element.

```jsx
// valid
(
<div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
 <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
 <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
</div>
)
// invalid
(
<p>I am a paragraph.</p> 
<p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
)
```

## Rendering JSX - ReactDOM.render()

`ReactDOM` is the name of a JavaScript library. This library contains several React-specific methods, all of which deal with [the DOM](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) in some way or another. `ReactDOM.render()` takes a JSX expression, creates a corresponding tree of DOM nodes, and adds that tree to the DOM. `ReactDOM.render()` *only updates DOM elements that have changed*. The first argument is *appended* to whatever element is selected by the *second* argument. The first argument has to be a jsx expression, it doesn’t have to literally *be* a JSX expression

> **Example**
>
> ```jsx
> import React from 'react';
> import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
> 
> const jsx = <h1>Hello world</h1>
> ReactDOM.render(jsx, document.getElementById('app'));
> ```
>
> ```html
> <!-- html and head left out! -->
> <body>
>  <main id="app"></main>
>  <!-- scripts left out! -->
> </body>
> ```

## JSX vs HTML

**1. class vs className.** In JSX, you can’t use the word `class`; use `className` instead.
```jsx
<h1 className="big">Hey</h1>
```
**2. Self-Closing Tags.** In HTML, it is *optional* to include a forward-slash immediately before the final angle-bracket. In JSX, you *have to* include the slash.
```jsx
<br />
<img />
<input />
```

## Javascript inside JSX

**1. Executing JS.** To get code interpreted as JavaScript wrap your code in *curly braces*.
```jsx
<h1>{2 + 3}</h1>
```

**2. Variables.** When injecting JavaScript into JSX, that JavaScript is part of the same environment as the rest of the JavaScript. This is often applied to set attributes.

```jsx
const name = 'Gerdo';
const greeting = <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;
```

**3. Event Listeners.** Create an event listener by giving a JSX element a special *attribute*.

```jsx
function myFunc() { /* do smth */ }
<img onClick={myFunc} />
```

**4. If statements.** It is impossible to inject an if statement into JSX.

Solution 1. If statement outside of JSX

```jsx
let myVar
if(condition) { myVar = '1' } else { myVar = '2' }
const jsx_expression = <h1>{myVar}</h1>
```

Solution 2. Ternary Operator

```jsx
const jsx = <h1>{condition ? '1' : '2' }</h1>
```

**5. && operator.** to make an element appear or not based on a condition use &&

```jsx
const jsx = {condition && <h1>Example</h1>}
```

**6. map().** Used for example to create lists

```jsx
const strings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me'];
const listItems = strings.map(string => <li>{string}</li>);
<ul>{listItems}</ul>
```

**7. Keys.**

When you make a list in JSX, sometimes your list will need to include something called `keys`. A `key` is a JSX attribute. The attribute’s *name* is `key`. The attribute’s *value* should be something unique, similar to an `id` attribute.
A list needs `keys` if either of the following are true:

 1. The list-items have *memory* from one render to the next. For instance, when a to-do list renders, each item must “remember” whether it was checked off. The items shouldn’t get amnesia when they render.
 2. A list’s order might be shuffled. For instance, a list of search results might be shuffled from one render to the next.
 ```jsx
 const people = ['Rowe', 'Prevost', 'Gare'];
 const peopleList = people.map((person, i) => <li key={'person_' + i}>{person}</li> );
 ReactDOM.render(<ul>{peopleList}</ul>, document.getElementById('app'));
 ```

**8. React.createElement**  It is possible to write React code without JSX [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#react.createelement).

```jsx
const h1 = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello, world"
);
```
