Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to introduce you to the Redux library. Redux is most commonly used with React to manage application state, but can also be used with other libraries and frameworks, such as Angular. Redux is good for when your application becomes very large and has lots of moving parts. You may not always need Redux in an application, but it is helpful to learn and a good thing to have on your resume.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Use the Redux library
- Understand why and when to use Redux in a React app
- Know how to use Redux as middleware logic
- Write tests in Redux
