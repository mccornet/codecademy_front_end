/*

Write a function sortYears() that takes in an array of years, 
and, using the built-in .sort() method, 
returns that array with the years sorted in descending order.

You can test your function when youâ€™re ready by 
passing in the years array or by making your own array of years!

*/

// Write your code here:
// the sort documentation uses a - b or b - a 
const sortYears = arr => arr.sort((a, b) => b - a)

// but it is also possible to use the comparator
const sortYears_v2 = arr => arr.sort((a, b) => a > b)

// Feel free to uncomment the below code to test your function:

const years = [1970, 1999, 1951, 1982, 1963, 2011, 2018, 1922]

console.log(sortYears(years))
console.log(sortYears_v2(years))
// Should print [ 2018, 2011, 1999, 1982, 1970, 1963, 1951, 1922 ]
